# github-webhook-example

This is an example project we used in our blog post we published here:
https://packetriot.com/updates/posts/http-inspector/

In our blog we shared a program that is available in this project that you can use to follow along.  Fork this repository and use your own repo to setup a webhook and connect it to your Packetriot tunnel.

You can debug the program and inspect its traffic by using out HTTP Inspector.  It's invoked with this command:

```
pktriot inspect <port-no>
```

More details are in our blog, thanks!
